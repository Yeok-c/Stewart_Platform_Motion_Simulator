    "We first load the Stewart Platform Object from the previous section and define the functions for streaming serial data.\n",

    "The motion capture data comes in 6 columns, Rx, Ry, Rz, Tx, Ty, Tz (Following Vicon Nexus' convention). Rotations are in degrees and Translation is in millimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon loading the CSV files, the following are already applied to the data:\n",
    "- [Tx, Ty, Tz] is scaled by 1/4 as the stewart platform is 1:4 scale of a life sized human torso. \n",
    "- [Tx, Ty, Tz] is high-pass filtered by 0.5 Hz to eliminate slow moving and DC components. This is to keep all the movement within the range of motion of the stewart platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the CSV files, we apply the following to in the code below:\n",
    "- Scale both Rotation and Translation by 1/2 - our stewart platform's range of operating range isn't large enough to accomodate for full range of motion of complex movements.\n",
    "- Convert rotation to radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further scale them individually later based on trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we define the functions used for serial communications and plot out the movements for a quick sanity check."
